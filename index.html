        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Accountant</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Professional background: Most of my family members are engaged in the accounting industry, so when I chose a major in university, I also chose accounting. Although I have not graduated yet, because my parents often tell me some of their experience at work, I believe that I know accounting better than my peers. When I was in high school, I joined some clubs, such as painting clubs. The activities in the club have cultivated my drawing ability and design ability. The members of the club often need to make some posters or make leaflets for the student union. After studying in a painting club in high school, I can also do some art work. My average GPA is above 3.5, and my grades in all major courses are A. In addition, I usually read some books on economics. I had an internship in a car sales company last summer, and I have a good understanding of the tasks that accountants usually do.<br><br>

        Self-evaluation: I have more professional knowledge than my peers, and I have a lot of free time. I am good at teamwork and can always provide some good ideas to the team in teamwork. I am also very social. I participated in debate competitions in high school and won the title of best debater.As a newcomer to the accounting profession, I take a positive working attitude to meet every challenge in my work. I have a good attitude and sense of responsibility, hard work, good at managing time, and used to face changes and challenges. I am good at learning, and I often make a study plan that suits me so that I can quickly learn the knowledge needed for the internship after the internship.I am a person who will try to succeed for the 100th time even if I fail 99 times. When I am under great pressure or encounter difficulties, I will actively seek solutions. I believe that there are always more solutions than difficulties. As long as I insist on working hard for my goal, don't give up, and don't shrink back, then I will be moving towards success.<br><br>

        Hobbies: I usually like to paint, read books, and do sports. Painting can improve my aesthetics and add an extra skill to me, so that I can draw pictures that make me happy, or help others through this skill. I often help others to make posters and board newspapers in school. When I help others, I think the value of my painting ability is reflected. Reading books can enrich my knowledge and make me better at writing. I like reading books very much, especially novels. Through reading novels, I can understand the characteristics of some places I have never been to, and I can also learn about the lives of other people, which makes me more gentle when dealing with strangers. In addition to novels, I also read books related to economics. When these books talk about some knowledge points, they often use past events as examples. This makes me feel that economy and history are closely connected, which is very magical. Doing exercises can make me healthy. I used to be in poor health and often felt tired. But through hard work, such as going for a run every morning, my body gradually becomes healthy. I no longer feel tired often, and I have a lot more energy.
